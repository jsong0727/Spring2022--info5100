//The interface is a blueprint to implement a class
//A class which has the abstract keyword in its declaration is called abstract class.
//An abstract class permits you to make functionality that subclasses can implement or override
//An interface only permits you to state functionality but not to implement it.
//A class can extend only one abstract class while a class can implement multiple interfaces.
